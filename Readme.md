# Avatar Gallery Plugin for NodeBB

A NodeBB plugin to display a gallery of avatars that users can select from and which admins can manage.

## Installation

Really simple, just install the plugin with `npm install nodebb-plugin-avatar-gallery` or via your forum's admin control panel.

## Configuration

Currently avatars are uploaded to /uploads/avatars/ and are given a unique id. In the future I might add configurable settings for this.
